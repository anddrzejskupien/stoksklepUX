## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

This project uses [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) for internationalization support. You can easily add multiple languages and switch between them in your application.

### Setup

1. **Locales**: Add your translation files in `src/plugins/i18n/locales/` (e.g., `en.json`, `pl.json`).
2. **Configuration**: The i18n plugin is configured in `src/plugins/i18n.js` and registered in `src/plugins/index.js`.
3. **Usage in Components**:
   - Use the `useI18n` composable in your Vue components:
     ```vue
     <script setup>
     import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n'
     const { t, locale } = useI18n()
     // Change language: locale.value = 'en'
     </script>
     <template>
       <div>{{ t('hello') }}</div>
     </template>
     ```
   - Add translation keys to your locale files and reference them with `t('key')`.

stayStore.adultsNumber = 2
stayStore.childrenNumber = 1
stayStore.dateOfStay = [new Date('2024-01-15'), new Date('2024-01-19')]

// Access pricing information
const totalPrice = stayStore.allParticipantsTotalPrice
const totalHours = stayStore.allParticipantsTotalHours
const discount = stayStore.finalDiscount
const hoursNeeded = stayStore.missingClassesForDiscount

// Check loyalty card
await stayStore.checkLoyaltyCardNumber('12345678')

// Update participant data
stayStore.participants[0].name = 'Jan'
stayStore.participants[0].surname = 'Kowalski'
stayStore.participants[0].insuranceIncluded = true

// Get participant-specific pricing
const participantPrice = stayStore.participantClassesTotalPrice('participant-id')
const insurancePrice = stayStore.participantInsuranceTotalPrice('participant-id')

// Submit booking
const bookingData = stayStore.event
</script>
```

#### Key Computed Properties:
- `event` - Complete booking object ready for API submission

### 2. PickedClassesStore (`src/stores/PickedClassesStore.js`)

The **PickedClassesStore** manages the temporary state during class selection. It acts as a staging area for class assignments before they're committed to the StayStore.

#### Key Responsibilities:

**Temporary Selection Management**
- Holds currently selected classes before final confirmation
- Maintains state during the class selection modal/flow
- Prevents accidental data loss during selection process

**Class Collection Structure**
- Organized by participant ID
- Per-date class assignments
- Supports multiple classes per participant per day
- Maintains class details:
  - Group details (ID, name, time slots, participant limits)
  - Activity type and skill level
  - Language preference
  - Duration and scheduling

**Selection Workflow**
- Initialize temporary state from StayStore
- Allow modifications without affecting main store
- Commit changes back to StayStore on confirmation
- Discard changes on cancellation

**Data Synchronization**
- Bidirectional sync with StayStore
- Preserves existing selections when opening modal
- Updates StayStore only on explicit save action

#### Usage Example:
```vue
<script setup>
import { usePickedClassesStore } from '@/stores/PickedClassesStore'
import { useStayStore } from '@/stores/StayStore'

const pickedStore = usePickedClassesStore()
const stayStore = useStayStore()

// Open class selection modal
const openClassModal = (participantId) => {
  // Load current selections into temporary store
  pickedStore.loadFromStayStore(participantId)
  // Show modal
}

// Add class to selection
pickedStore.addClassForDate(participantId, date, classData)

// Remove class from selection
pickedStore.removeClassForDate(participantId, date, classId)

// Save selections
const saveSelections = (participantId) => {
  pickedStore.commitToStayStore(participantId)
  // Close modal
}

// Cancel selections
const cancelSelections = () => {
  pickedStore.resetSelections()
  // Close modal
}
</script>
```

#### Store Methods:
- `loadFromStayStore(participantId)` - Initialize from current participant data
- `addClassForDate(participantId, date, classData)` - Add class to temporary selection
- `removeClassForDate(participantId, date, classId)` - Remove class from selection
- `commitToStayStore(participantId)` - Save changes to main store
- `resetSelections()` - Clear temporary state

### 3. ViewControlStore (`src/stores/ViewControlStore.js`)

The **ViewControlStore** orchestrates the multi-step booking flow and manages global UI state throughout the application.

#### Key Responsibilities:

**Multi-Step Navigation**
- Tracks current position in booking flow
- Parent steps: Date/Participants → Classes → Review/Payment
- Child steps within each parent (sub-steps)

- Each step must be marked complete before advancing
- Ensures data integrity throughout booking process

#### Usage Example:
```vue
<script setup>
import { useViewControlStore } from '@/stores/ViewControlStore'

const viewStore = useViewControlStore()

// Access current position
const currentStep = viewStore.currentStep
// { parent: 1, child: 1 }

// Check if user can proceed
if (viewStore.isStepOneCompleted) {
  viewStore.currentStep.parent = 2
}

// Mark step as completed
viewStore.isStepOneCompleted = true
viewStore.isStepTwoCompleted = true

// Control stepper from outside
const stepperRef = ref(null)
viewStore.setParentStepper(stepperRef)

// Navigate programmatically
viewStore.parentStepperRef?.next()
viewStore.parentStepperRef?.prev()

// Sub-step management
viewStore.currentStep.child = 2 // Move to next sub-step
</script>
```

#### State Properties:

const timerStore = useTimerStore()

// Start timer when booking begins
const startBooking = () => {
  timerStore.startTimer()
}

// Display timer
const timeRemaining = timerStore.formattedTime // "14:35"

// Check if timer is running
if (timerStore.isTimerRunning) {
  // Show timer toast
}

// Stop timer on successful booking
const completeBooking = async () => {
  await submitBooking()
  timerStore.stopTimer()
  timerStore.resetTimer()
}

// Handle expiration
watch(() => timerStore.isExpired, (expired) => {
  if (expired) {
    // Show expiration message
    // Redirect to start
    router.push('/')
  }
})
</script>
```

#### State Properties:
- `timeLeft` - Seconds remaining (default: 900 = 15 minutes)
- `isTimerRunning` - Boolean: is timer currently active
- `isExpired` - Boolean: has timer reached zero
- `timerInterval` - Internal interval reference

- `decrementTime()` - Internal: decrease by 1 second

### Store Communication & Architecture

The four stores work together in a coordinated architecture to provide a complete booking experience:

#### Store Relationships:

1. **StayStore** ↔ **StayConfigStore**: Core business logic uses configuration data
   - StayStore retrieves pricing tiers based on total hours
   - Configuration provides skill levels, activity types, and pricing matrices
   - Centralized configuration ensures consistency across the application

2. **ViewControlStore** → **StayStore**: UI flow orchestrates business logic
   - ViewControlStore manages which step is active
   - StayStore validates data for step completion
   - Step progression depends on StayStore validation states

3. **PickedClassesStore** ↔ **StayStore**: Temporary staging and final storage
   - PickedClassesStore acts as a buffer during class selection
   - Changes are committed to StayStore only on user confirmation
   - Prevents data loss during selection process

4. **TimerStore**: Independent session management
   - Runs independently to enforce booking time limits
   - Triggers cleanup across all stores on expiration
   - Integrated with toast notification system

#### Complete Booking Flow Example:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useStayStore } from '@/stores/StayStore'
import { useStayConfigStore } from '@/stores/StayConfigStore'
import { useViewControlStore } from '@/stores/ViewControlStore'
import { usePickedClassesStore } from '@/stores/PickedClassesStore'
import { useTimerStore } from '@/stores/TimerStore'

const stayStore = useStayStore()
const configStore = useStayConfigStore()
const viewStore = useViewControlStore()
const pickedStore = usePickedClassesStore()
const timerStore = useTimerStore()

// Step 1: Initialize booking
const startBooking = () => {
  timerStore.startTimer() // Start 15-minute countdown
  viewStore.currentStep = { parent: 1, child: 1 }
}

// Step 1: Configure dates and participants
const completeStepOne = () => {
  stayStore.adultsNumber = 2
  stayStore.childrenNumber = 1
  stayStore.dateOfStay = [new Date('2024-01-15'), new Date('2024-01-19')]
  
  if (stayStore.participantsNumberCondition && stayStore.dateOfStay) {
    viewStore.isStepOneCompleted = true
    viewStore.currentStep.parent = 2
  }
}

// Step 2: Select classes (using PickedClassesStore)
const selectClassesForParticipant = (participantId) => {
  // Load current selections into temporary store
  pickedStore.loadFromStayStore(participantId)
  
  // User makes changes via UI...
  pickedStore.addClassForDate(participantId, '2024-01-15', classData)
  
  // On confirm, commit to main store
  pickedStore.commitToStayStore(participantId)
  
  // Check if all participants have classes
  if (allParticipantsHaveClasses) {
    viewStore.isStepTwoCompleted = true
    viewStore.currentStep.parent = 3
  }
}

// Step 3: Review and complete booking
const completeBooking = async () => {
  // Check for loyalty card discount
  if (loyaltyCardNumber) {
    await stayStore.checkLoyaltyCardNumber(loyaltyCardNumber)
  }
  
  // Get final pricing from StayStore using StayConfigStore pricing
  const finalPrice = stayStore.allParticipantsTotalPrice
  const discount = stayStore.finalDiscount
  
  // Submit booking
  const bookingData = stayStore.event
  await submitToAPI(bookingData)
  
  // Stop timer on success
  timerStore.stopTimer()
  timerStore.resetTimer()
  
  viewStore.isStepThreeCompleted = true
}

// Handle timer expiration
watch(() => timerStore.isExpired, (expired) => {
  if (expired) {
    // Clear all booking data
    stayStore.$reset()
    pickedStore.$reset()
    viewStore.$reset()
    
    // Redirect to start
    router.push('/')
  }
})
</script>
```

## 📄 Pages

### `/payment` - Payment Confirmation & Status Page

The **Payment Page** (`src/pages/payment.vue`) is the final destination page that displays the payment process status and outcome. This page handles multiple payment states and provides appropriate user feedback for each scenario.

#### Purpose
- Display payment confirmation after successful booking completion
- Show payment failure messages with recovery options
- Handle payment processing states
- Redirect users to payment gateway when needed
- Provide clear next steps for users in each payment state

#### Payment States

The page responds to four different payment states managed by the **StayStore**:

**1. Payment Completed (`isPaymentCompleted`)**
- **Visual**: Green check circle icon
- **Message**: Booking confirmation
- **Action**: Return to homepage button
- **Use Case**: After successful payment processing, confirms the booking is complete
- **User Flow**: Users can return to the homepage to start a new booking

**2. Payment Failed (`isPaymentFailed`)**
- **Visual**: Orange exclamation icon
- **Message**: Payment failed notification
- **Action**: Return to homepage button
- **Use Case**: When payment processing encounters an error or is rejected
- **User Flow**: Allows users to restart the booking process

**3. Payment In Process**
- **Visual**: Clock/progress icon (mdi-progress-clock)
- **Message**: Payment processing notification
- **Action**: Return to payment page button
- **Use Case**: Intermediate state while payment is being verified
- **User Flow**: Users can check payment status again
- **Note**: Currently shows when `isPaymentFailed` is true (may need correction)

**4. Redirecting to Payment (`isRedirecting`)**
- **Visual**: Clock/progress icon (mdi-progress-clock)
- **Message**: Redirecting to payment gateway
- **Action**: Proceed to payment button
- **Use Case**: When user is being directed to external payment processor
- **User Flow**: Manual redirect option if automatic redirect fails

#### Component Structure

```vue
<template>
  <VContainer max-width="990">
    <!-- Payment Completed State -->
    <VCard v-if="stayStore.isPaymentCompleted">
      <CheckGreenIcon />
      <h2>{{ $t('booking_confirmed') }}</h2>
      <VBtn @click="$router.push('/')">
        {{ $t('back_to_homepage') }}
      </VBtn>
    </VCard>

    <!-- Payment Failed State -->
    <VCard v-if="stayStore.isPaymentFailed">
      <ExclamationIcon />
      <h2>{{ $t('payment_failed') }}</h2>
      <VBtn @click="$router.push('/')">
        {{ $t('back_to_homepage') }}
      </VBtn>
    </VCard>

    <!-- Redirecting State -->
    <VCard v-if="stayStore.isRedirecting">
      <VIcon icon="mdi-progress-clock" />
      <h2>{{ $t('redirecting_to_payment') }}</h2>
      <VBtn @click="$router.push('/payment')">
        {{ $t('proceed_to_payment') }}
      </VBtn>
    </VCard>
  </VContainer>
</template>
```

#### Integration with StayStore

The payment page relies on the following StayStore state properties:

```javascript
// In StayStore.js
const isPaymentCompleted = ref(false) // Set to true after successful payment
const isPaymentFailed = ref(false)    // Set to true if payment fails
const isRedirecting = ref(false)      // Set to true when redirecting to gateway
```

#### Usage Example

```vue
<script setup>
import { useStayStore } from '@/stores/StayStore'
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'

const stayStore = useStayStore()
const router = useRouter()

// After booking submission
const submitBooking = async () => {
  try {

#### Internationalization

The payment page uses the following translation keys from `src/plugins/i18n/locales/`:

- `booking_confirmed` - Success message title
- `booking_confirmed_info` - Success message description
- `payment_failed` - Failure message title
- `payment_in_process` - Processing message title
- `payment_in_process_info` - Processing message description
- `redirecting_to_payment` - Redirect message title
- `redirect_info` - Redirect message description
- `back_to_homepage` - Homepage button text
- `back_to_payment` - Return to payment button text
- `proceed_to_payment` - Manual redirect button text

#### Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Max width of 990px, centered container
- **Mobile**: Reduced padding (px-2) for better mobile experience
- **Flex Layout**: Vertical centering and spacing for all states
- **Icons**: Consistent 32px size for visual feedback

    ├─→ Payment Completed → Return to homepage
    ├─→ Payment Failed → Return to homepage (retry booking)
    ├─→ Payment Processing → Check status again
    └─→ Redirecting → External payment gateway
```

#### Best Practices

1. **State Management**: Always set only one payment state at a time in StayStore
2. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. **Navigation**: Always provide a way back to homepage or retry mechanism
4. **Loading States**: Use redirecting state for seamless gateway transitions
5. **Cleanup**: Reset payment states when starting a new booking
